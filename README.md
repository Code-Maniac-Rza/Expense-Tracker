## Code Structure

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Organization

HTML: The HTML files (index.html, budgets.html, reports.html) are organized with clear sections and comments to improve readability. Each file starts with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and is structured with a head section containing meta information and links to stylesheets, followed by a body section that contains the content.

CSS: All CSS code is placed in external files located in the assets/css directory. These files are linked in the head section of the HTML files.

Example:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/styles.css">

JavaScript: All JavaScript code is placed in external files located in the js directory. These files are linked just above the closing </body> tag in the HTML files.

Example:

<script src="assets/js/scripts.js"></script>

## Code Sections and Readability

**Consistent Indentation**: All code is consistently indented using 2 spaces for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This ensures that the code is easy to read and maintain.

**Commenting**: Sections of the code are clearly defined with comments, making it easy to navigate and understand the purpose of each block of code.
